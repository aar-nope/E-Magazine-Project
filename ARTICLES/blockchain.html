	<h2>How does Blockchain enhance Mobile Security?</h2>

	<p class="one">As per some of the experts in the field, Blockchain can be the fastest growing technology in the upcoming generations.   Before we get into the topic, let's we have a short conversation about blockchain. In simple terms, Blockchain is nothing but a collection of data are stored in each block that is secured and interlinked with each other using cryptography. </p>

	<p>The name of the first block in a blockchain is called genesis block. Blockchain technology is a digital record of transaction information made with cryptocurrencies. Each blockchain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block. Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed public ledger that can store all transaction records occurring between two persons in a verified manner.</p> 
	
	<p>Using this technology, we can perform any kind of cryptocurrency transactions without using centralized servers. The main advantages of blockchain technology are transparency, immutability, decentralized, and security.</p>

	<p> <strong>Where can we use Blockchain Technology in Mobile Apps?  </strong> Blockchain has many advantages apart from the online transaction process. Developers should have a clear vision about blockchain technology which will be helpful to launch successful mobile applications integrated with blockchain technology. The below-mentioned areas are very important while developing mobile apps where blockchain would have a great impact on it:- 
		<ol> 
			<li>Providing Identity</li>
			<li>Secured Payments</li>
			<li>Managing Information and transactional records</li>
			<li>DNS/PKI</li>
			<li>Mutual agreements between the financial parties</li>
		</ol>
	</p>	

	<p><strong>How to Implement Blockchain in Mobile Applications? </strong>  Before we implement blockchain technology in mobile apps there are so many things to consider while doing this. First, you have to find out what kind of features to implement into it which will help the users learn how blockchain is safe for mobile apps. Next thing we have to mainly focus on are the transactions that blockchain will oversee. It consists of two activities:- 
		<ol>
			<li>Negotiate the ownership of shared resource value.</li>
			<li>Record multiple transaction data.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<p>One important thing you have to remember while developing a mobile app integrating blockchain is that you have to satisfy all kinds of people. If you want to build a blockchain-based mobile for your business, you need to hire a professional blockchain app developer who can help you get ideas and also to know about the cost of developing mobile apps.</p>

	<p><strong>How Blockchain Technology Enhance Mobile App Security?</strong> The features discussed above have many benefits in developing a mobile app for your business. Below mentioned are some of the ways how blockchain helps increase mobile security:-

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Transparency of Data:</strong> Blockchain allows users to keep their transactional details on the decentralized system where everybody can access the data in a real-time who are all interconnected with the computer networks. Because blockchain technology won't allow to change the original data without the knowledge of anyone's eye, it makes them more secure and transparent.</li>

			<li><strong>Provides Secured Infrastructure:</strong> Blockchain offers the mobile app owners to change your infrastructure to the decentralized platform which gives them more security while sharing information with others and it allows them to store DNS entries which can provide more control over the domain. So almost no one can manipulate with the DNS Entries.</li>

			<li><strong>Get Rid of Passwords:</strong> If you have set a strong password for your devices, there is a possibility of leaks. With Blockchain technology, you don't need to set any password for your device (or) while making transactions. The person who is involved in transactions generally makes the payments through an SSL Certificate. However, blockchain technology makes more visible and accessible to all and also avoids unwanted possibilities of being false.</li>

			<li><strong>Security:</strong> One of the essential things when comes to blockchain technology is security. No one can hack the data stored in each block Free Web Content, not in a centralized server. Blockchain offers cryptography with encrypted private key which prevents any misuse of information while making transactions. </li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<p class="def"><strong>Conclusion: </strong>  Blockchain Technology will be widely used in the mobile app development field in the future because it has lots of benefits as discussed before. Every developer has to adapt and explore new things while developing mobile apps with blockchain technology. Developers have to utilize their time to know about blockchain which helps to increase the security of mobile apps..</p>

	<h2>Artificial Intelligence in Science Fiction</h2>

	<p>Science fiction has built up the idea of artificial intelligence for years. Giving machines intelligence often spells the end of mankind as they then rise up against their creators and violently free themselves from oppression. There are cautionary tales such as in the film "Spider Man 2" in which the robotic arms of Dr. Octavius start controlling his brain...</p>
