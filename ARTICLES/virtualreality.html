	<h2>Future of Virtual Reality</h2>
	<p class="one">You must have heard the term virtual reality many times before, but have you ever wondered about its future and how it is already impacting our lives. Virtual reality is actually the simulation of real environment in the form of computer generated 3D images.</p>

	<p>Let’s talk about what virtual reality creators do to provide users authentic physics-based interaction. The cutting-edge virtual reality technology is based on algorithms control software and mechanical components.</p>

	<p>By using wearable display devices, like <em>head-mounted displays (HMD)</em> or <em>virtual reality glasses</em>, You can view computer generated images and interact with them in 3D space. These devices receive information from computer system and feed sensory input to the user. They also respond based on user’s actions, like eyes movements, by creating new image.</p>

	<p><strong>Some of the many applications of VR includes:-</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Video Games</li>
		<li>Sports</li>
		<li>Engineering</li>
		<li>Construction</li>
		<li>Military</li>
		<li>Education</li>
		<li>Healthcare</li>
		<li>Training and Simulation</li>

	<p>As of now, mostly research laboratories are using virtual reality systems since the cost of hardware and software required for it is too high. But nevertheless, the future holds great promise for virtual reality as technology advancement has made several things affordable and more accessible many times in the past.</p>

	<p>Why Virtual Reality Games have become Popular?
	Virtual reality games have become very popular as players love playing in a 3D environment they can immerse themselves in and interact with that environment during the game. Social card games are expected to benefit a lot from virtual reality as they are all about engagement. Thus, it won’t be wrong to say that virtual reality has incredible potential to make social card games more compelling, interactive and successful.</p>

	<h2>How Blockchain Technology increases Mobile Apps Security</h2>

	<p>Blockchain technology is a digital record of transaction information made with cryptocurrencies. Each blockchain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block. Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed public ledger that can store all transaction records occurring between two persons in a verified manner. Using this technology, we can perform any kind of cryptocurrency transactions without using centralized servers...</p>
