		<li><span class="def">Be strong with fundamentals</span>
			<p>Every experienced person will give these tips when you ask them how to start learning Java. If you are a newbie and you have no experience with any other programming language in the past, you must start with the basic concepts of that language. Enroll to a course so that you can easily pick up the advanced concepts in Java technology. When you attend the Java workshops or do projects based on Java, you will understand the concepts very well. Basics are a must for learning Java as well as other programming languages.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span class="def">Keep practicing</span>
			<p>Try to practice some simple problems from the internet or from other resources that is apt for freshers, like input a number and outputting what you have entered. Then whenever you find a complete program just try to execute and test how it works. This practicing method will help you write own Java programs.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span class="def">Writing your codes on paper</span>
			<p>This is a good method for learning code in short span of time. If you are a beginner try to write your codes on paper and this is the best way to become an expert. Understanding your code on the page may be difficult at first but when you keep on doing it, you will become a fast Java learner in no time.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span class="def">Carefully set your Algorithm</span>
			<p>You must clearly set your algorithm first to solve a problem in Java. Algorithm tells you how to solve the problem in step by step approach and output the required result. It helps you to trial and test and get the desired output. After some series of tests if you get the right, you have done correctly, otherwise check your algorithm repeatedly and try to trace the error in your code. If the problem continues, the next step will be helpful to you.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span class="def">Try to read Java programming as often as possible</span>
